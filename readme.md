# Flutter-Folder

A simple node module that automatically creates project subfolders in a Flutter project's lib folder. The module creates the following folders:

+ `assets`
+ `assets/images`
+ `assets/other`
+ `lib/models`
+ `lib/pages`
+ `lib/services`
+ `lib/utils`
+ `lib/widgets`

Should also update the pubspec.yaml file to add an `assets` secrtion pointing to the assets folders
