# Flutter-Folder

A simple node module that automatically creates project subfolders in a Flutter project's lib folder. The module first checks to see that the terminal window points to a Flutter project, then creates the following folders:

+ `assets`
+ `assets/images`
+ `assets/other`
+ `lib/models`
+ `lib/pages`
+ `lib/services`
+ `lib/utils`
+ `lib/widgets`

To install the module, open a terminal window and execute the following command:

```shell
npm install -g flutter-folders
```

To create the folders in your flutter project, open a terminal window, navigate to the Flutter project folder, then execute the following command:

```shell
flutter-folders
```
